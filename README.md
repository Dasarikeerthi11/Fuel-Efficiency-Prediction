This fuel efficiency prediction system utilizes an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to provide a more robust and accurate solution compared to traditional machine learning models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). By harnessing the power of deep learning, the ANN can model complex, non-linear relationships between vehicle specifications, road conditions, and driving behavior, resulting in more reliable and dynamic fuel efficiency predictions. Unlike existing systems, which struggle with real-time data adaptation and overfitting, the ANN model enhances performance through regularization and dropout techniques, improving generalization. Additionally, the system can efficiently process large datasets, handle high-dimensional input features, and integrate real-time driving conditions, making it highly scalable and adaptable for future data sources. This approach addresses the limitations of traditional models and provides a flexible, efficient solution for fuel efficiency forecasting that is better suited for diverse real-world environments.
